PMI_bact_2702691.out paper threshold; only bact
PMI_default_2702702.out default threshold; all features;
PMI_withlabel.out: default threshold; feartures; but  data for modeling is not the relative abundance (this is the one sent to Scott)
PMI_default_2705304.out is the update of 2702691 where also filtered the data by threshold=0.001 for lasso selection(it seems the svm code is wrong from here)
PMI_default_2786898.out: result is changed (not sure why)
PMI_default_2812667.out is when update the parameter of SVM to rbf
PMI_default_2813666.out: add more models, and add the results of contingency table
PMI_0114_2830149.out: same with the last one, just show the results of all
PMI_0114_2830159.out: results of lasso and lasso fine tune after FS
PMI_0116_2833123.out: results of AE
